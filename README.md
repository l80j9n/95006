SUBJECT OUTLINE 
95006 TD: Envisioning futures worth wanting 
Subject description 
This subject introduces students to key concepts   and   methods   from   the   transdisciplinary   field   of futures   studies.   Skills   and   knowledge   in this area are   increasingly   in demand   in   industry and the   public sector,   and they   are   fundamental tools to enable more effective participation   in   addressing the wicked   problems   faced   by   business,   government,   communities, and humanity as   a whole. 
Working   individually and   in teams to complete a participatory futures   project   in   partnership with   the   City   of Sydney council, students apply approaches to create and critically   evaluate   images   of the future,   identify   signals   of change, explore how possible futures could emerge, and   ultimately   propose   a   future   worth   wanting.   Through   these   place-based   projects, students explore the past, present, and   possible   futures   of   Sydney,   identify   opportunities   and   challenges   for   a   sustainable urban future, and critically reflect on   how   their   own   perspectives   and   values   influence   their thinking   and their actions.
